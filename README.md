# Instagram Stalker (Simple)

This is a simple Python script that allows you to extract and compare follower lists from an Instagram account. The script helps you track changes in your follower list over time, identifying who unfollowed and who started following.

## Features

- **Follower Extraction**: The script allows you to extract the follower list from an Instagram account (if you have a data source for this, such as a file with followers).
- **Follower List Comparison**: The script compares two text files containing usernames (followers) and shows who started following and who unfollowed.
- **Graphical Interface**: Uses Tkinter to allow the user to select the files with the follower list.
- **Customization Support**: You can insert ASCII art to customize the output in the terminal.
